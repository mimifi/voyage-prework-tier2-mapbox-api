To see the ZenHub tab on the GitHub repo webpage requires that you install ZenHub's browser extension. For more
information visit the [ZenHub Browser Extension page](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) and these 
[installation instructions](https://t.ly/3v8w).

If you would like to add these tasks to your repo so you can track the progress of your Solo Project and so they will be 
more readily available for reference you will need to manually add new issues to your ZenHub board and copy/paste the text
in our issues to yours.

Good Luck!!!
